# Redux workshop - Spotify client

Today's workshop will see us build an application using _real data_ from the Spotify API.

Here is what the _final product_ will look like:

This is an application designed for _mobile browsers_. It loads data in real-time from the Spotify API, and stores this data in Redux.

This screenshot may not look like a lot of work, but getting everything set up can be quite challenging!

Here is the final product after all stretch goals have been completed:
